# Problem Statement
1) The discovery challenge task is to define a problem which can help the bank to improve their services (e.g. define the notion of good or bad client, suggest new/current service that can be offered to a group of clients etc.); from the KDD point of view the problem can be classification, prediction or description
2) Creating a Datamart to analyze the financial status of customers, segment the customers into a risky
customer and potential customers (interested in bank products like cards, loans, etc) and create
correlations between the features to track business trends.
